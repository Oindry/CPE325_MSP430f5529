# CPE325_MSP430f5529
CPE 325: Embedded Systems Laboratory @ UAH (Demo programs for EXP-MSP430F5529lp Launchpad)

This repository contains demonstration code files for programs to be used with MSP430F5529 Launchpad boards. The course **Introduction to Embedded Computer Systems** i.e CPE 323 and the corresponding laboratory works CPE325 at the **University of Alabama in Huntsville** deals with practical works no MSP430 microcontrollers.

## Laboratory 0:

Laboratory 0 demonstrates the installation procedure for **Code Compose Studio** CCS in Windows machine. Code Composer Studio is the IDE from **Texas Instruments** that will be used for this course. Please find the demo file for toggling the LEDs to verify setup at [this link](Lab0/Lab0_D0.c).

## Laboratory 1:

Laboratory 1 discusses various aspects of using the CCS IDE. The laboratory is designed to give a student basic knowledge on debugging, compiling and inspecting various aspects of the program while using CCS. Please find the demo codes inside the respective folder.

## Laboratory 3:

Laboratory 3 discusses interfacing information for MSP430 microcontrollers. First, the board in use will be introduced. Then, students will be introduced with initializing inputs and outputs using parallel ports to interface LEDs and Switches. Please find the demo codes inside the respective folder.
